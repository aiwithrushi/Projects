# RFM Customer Segmentation using K-Means

## Objective
Segment customers based on purchasing behavior using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis to support data-driven marketing and retention strategies.

## Business Problem
Retail businesses need to identify high-value customers, loyal customers, and customers at risk of churn to optimize campaigns and revenue.

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling returned and invalid transactions
- RFM feature engineering
- Log transformation and standard scaling
- K-Means clustering
- Optimal K selection using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score
- Business-driven customer segment labeling

## Customer Segments
- Champions
- Loyal Customers
- At Risk
- Low Value / Inactive

## Key Insights
- Champions contribute disproportionately to total revenue
- Returned transactions caused minimal revenue loss (~0.18%)
- Clear behavioral separation observed across customer groups

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Output
Final customer segmentation exported for business consumption.
